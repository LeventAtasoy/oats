  # A YAML array containing test names to be executed by OATS. Each name must
  # either be a test directory, or another YAML file which contains
  # test_files.  If an input is a YAML file, the test_files it contains
  # will be executed after merging in the YAML contents.
  test_files: [ examples/expectedException ] # C-L,R-U:rec

  # A YAML array listing YAML files describing environments to be executed for
  # each test. This is a way of multiplexing the test cases. OATS will repeat
  # the execution of each test files after merging in the oats_data from the
  # each YAML. Typical use of environments is to repeat the tests for different
  # environments or different parameters. You may also want to make a copy of
  # the environment YAML file in dir_tests/environments into your own
  # dir_environments directory and customize the E-V:rec entries for yourself.
