# OATS Initialization File
---
# To keep maintenance to a minimum, uncomment only the parameters you need in
# your oats_user.yml or an environment.yml file. When you uncomment a parameter
# do not forget to uncomment all the parents of the parameters also in order to
# keep the YAML file valid.
#  Parameters designated as:
# * R-U:rec are recommended for use in oats_user.yml
# * R-U:opt are for occasional use in oats_user.yml
# * C-L can also be over-ridden via command-line
# * E-V:recl are recommended for use in environment environment files.
# * none: are best to leave to system defaults unless required

# String values containing 'Oats.' and 'ENV[' are  evaluated as Ruby
# expressions referring to the previously loaded YAML Oats.data and environment
# variables. If after an evaluation resulting value is 'previous_old_value', then
# previous value is restored.
# Examples of boolean expressions which can be used in tests:
#  Oats.data['env']['type'] == 'qa'
#  Oats.global['agent'] ? "oatsuserapi@gmail.com":'previous_oats_value'

# OATS recognizes the following key modifiers
# (define) # used by oats_user and environments, adds new keys w/o issuing error messages
# (default) # used by test.yml, defines default values
# Advertiser (define): Name
# Setting this at any level will prevent (define) errors, at least in all keys below
# and possibly in other branches of Oats.data. Reset it under other branches if needed.
# define_always: TRUE

# This section contains parameters controlling oats execution.  All
# parameters in this section plus a few from other sections can be overridden
# from the commandline (For details, see 'oats.rb \--help'.)
# * If an input is a YAML file, it may include other test_files which are
#   executed after merging in the YAML contents.
# * environments included in the any test YAML are applied to the tests listed in
#   the YAML, multiplexing the test cases.

# For performance and unambiguity, path should be given relative to the folder
# of the test for test yamls, or relative to test_dir.
# Otherwise it will be searched in test_dir.
# Over-rides used in user, environment, or list YAMLs are checked for consistency
# with this oats_ini.yml definitions (keys included files are not checked.)
